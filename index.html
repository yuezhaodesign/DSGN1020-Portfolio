                <h2>Ulises Carrión - Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts</h2>
                <p> The article suggests that Mail Art focuses more on the artistic expression than the medium itself, emphasizing the unique emotions and significance conveyed through the art on mail. The author critiques the traditional views of Mail Art as being merely easy, cheap, unpretentious, and democratic. Instead, he argues that the quality of art produced in Mail Art is more important than these characteristics. Although Mail Art allows artists freedom in creation, it still involves adhering to certain pre-established rules and covering mailing costs, which the author refers to as confronting 'the monster.' This 'monster' represents the challenges and uncertainties faced when mailing art, which may not always survive the process.
    
                    I'm unclear about the phrase, "When we are knocking at the Monster's door, what does it count? The answer is simple: it counts how hard you are knocking." Does 'knocking' refer to expressing oneself freely in Mail Art? Could we enhance the resilience of Mail Art against these challenges by holding competitions, rewarding the best Mail Art for mass production, and creating digital 3D models for Mail Art?</p>

                <h2>Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</h2>
               <p>These readings have helped me gain a deeper understanding of the unique role websites play in expressing one's personality and identity. The websites ‘allow the author to create not only works but also the world’.  Unlike social media profiles, which follow uniform formats and color schemes, personal websites offer a more flexible canvas for displaying individual style and taste. As I browsed through many portfolios of designers and developers, I noticed how distinct and engaging they are. This applies to corporate websites as well—many game company websites, for example, use dark backgrounds to project a "cool" and tech-forward image. What elements are important in expressing one’s identity in web design?

                As one author noted, “A website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished.” This rings true for two reasons: first, creators' styles evolve with their experiences, and second, web design trends continuously shift with changing aesthetic preferences and new technologies. Based on my observation, websites today are more streamlined and spacious compared to those from a decade ago. There are even innovative sites employing 3D designs and generative AI. The evolution of web design is ongoing and endless. So how does the new technology change the design and the ways of interactivity in the websites?  </p>

                <h2>Olia Lialina - STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives</h2>
               <p>The author discusses the once-popular free web hosting service, Geocities, and its shutdown in 2010. Through his perspective and experience in archiving old websites, we gain insight into the charm of the web during that era. One poignant observation about Geocities is its independence from search engine algorithms. In the past, the internet was largely built by individuals who independently created and linked content, allowing for the discovery of websites that modern algorithms might overlook. Today, however, we are often mere consumers of content, highly curated by AI, losing the joy of stumbling upon hidden online gems.

                Another intriguing phenomenon is the longevity of websites hosted on Geocities compared to contemporary sites using user-owned domains. These old sites, like the ancient city of Pompeii preserved amid modern development, are invaluable archives of past internet cultures—capturing diverse styles, formats, and visionary ideas of their creators. These digital artifacts will undoubtedly be preserved in web libraries and museums, serving as historical records.
                
                Beyond serving as nostalgic relics, what other significances do archived websites hold?
                What are the crucial factors for individuals to maintain their websites over extended periods? </p>

                <h2>David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design</h2>
               <p>I have learned Gestalt psychology in a psychology course, where it is used to explore how the cognition work, but never expected this can be used in graphic design. This article focused on how we organize and interpret visual stimuli, often in terms of Gestalt principles. It discusses the difficulty in perceiving discrete elements and instead emphasizes how the mind organizes these into larger, meaningful groups. The impact of Gestalt can be seen in logo design, where elements like proximity, similarity, and closure allow a logo to appear as a cohesive and recognizable shape, even when composed of simple, separate parts. This helps viewers perceive the logo quickly and intuitively, making it memorable and effective in conveying brand identity. 

                (1) How can we create simple and unique logo using Gestalt principles?
                
                (2) What are the other applications of Gestalt principles in design areas?</p>

                <h2>Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</h2>
               <p>The article highlights the evolving dynamics between print and e-publishing, showcasing the development of hybrid media forms that merge the tactile and tangible aspects of print with the expansive connectivity of digital platforms. As digital publishing expands, the focus shifts from the format of the media to the influence and interaction it enables. My understanding is that the essence of media lies in its ability to create a network of influence and engagement among people, with the format (print or digital) becoming less relevant than the potential for connectivity and interaction. As hybrid media evolves, it encapsulates both the physical and the digital, allowing for local exchanges through physical print as well as global sharing via online networks.

                How can we cultivate a ‘romanticism of local physical exchange’ within the context of hybrid media?
                Should digital interactive gestures imitate the physical handling of print media, or should we innovate entirely new interactions for e-publishing?</p>

                <h2>Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</h2>
               <p>After reading this article, I realized how crucial alt-text is for accessibility, particularly for the blind users. Alt-text provides descriptions of images, but it's distinct from full image descriptions. It plays a vital role in helping blind or visually impaired individuals understand online content. Crafting effective alt-text requires skill and creativity. The author compares writing alt-text to both poetry and translation. As poetry, it should be concise, creative, and expressive. As translation, it doesn’t have to be entirely objective; instead, it should capture the image’s tone, style, and context, allowing for various interpretations.

                Here are my questions:
                
                The article mentions that alt-text is just one part of accessibility. What other elements are important for website accessibility, and how can we ensure a website is fully accessible?
                Should alt-text be used for logos on websites, or is it unnecessary?</p>

                <h2>Ramsey Nasser - "A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital</h2>
               <p>As a student whose native language is not English, I deeply resonate with this article. I started learning to code this year, and despite having studied English for many years, certain programming concepts can still be challenging. For instance, when I first encountered int() and str(), I could not connect them with "integer" and "string." Learning a new programming language takes me longer because I need to memorize various functions and keywords in addition to grasping the syntax. The author also references Seymour Papert, a renowned educator I studied in my education courses. He championed educational equality and promoted "culturally responsive pedagogy." This raises the question: Do we need a "culturally responsive design"? The answer is yes! For example, computer keyboards have been adapted to different languages. However, can we code in languages other than English? Unfortunately, this is unlikely, as English has long dominated the field, establishing the standards and foundation for programming. Since computer science builds on existing code, English remains the default. Therefore, translating programming concepts is crucial to lowering the learning barrier and making coding more accessible. Thankfully, tools like ChatGPT have made this possible—I asked it to explain code in Chinese, and it does so effectively!

                My questions:
                
                What is the influence of the large language model for the accessibility of programming language?
                How can we make the design of website accessible to different culture?</p>

                <h2>Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)</h2>
                <p>The paper explores shifts in graphic design's use of "surface" and "sign" across modernist, postmodernist, and hypermodernist aesthetics. Duvall discusses the evolution from modernism's one-to-one sign relationships, which aimed for clarity and standardization, through postmodernism’s fragmented, ambiguous sign use that disrupted meaning and aesthetics. In hypermodernism, signs are interconnected through a digital, hyperlinked environment, where surface is virtually infinite and immaterial. This shift parallels the digital space’s ability to overlay, hyperlink, and infinitely replicate signs. He examines how contemporary graphic design, now deeply rooted in a virtual, meme-influenced world, operates as an indicator of cultural change. Typical graphic design’s use of iconic symbols, like Disney imagery, represents a resistance to commercial homogenization and conveys complex, hyperlinked meanings with minimal alteration, reflecting both individual interpretation and standardized, collective iconography.


                    1. What is the motivation for these changes from modernist, postmodernist to hypermodernism?
                    
                    2. What is the design principles for hypermodernism? Straightforward? Representing cultural traits?</p>

                <h2>Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed</h2>
                <p>The transformation of information feeds has shifted from traditional announcements—rich in dense information that draws attention through materiality, addressivity, and difference—to a smooth, continuous, and endless flow that is syntactic and interactive. The network now allows information to flow to us every day and every minute, facilitating access but also raising trust issues. There are more ways to interpret posts and display information in interesting formats. However, since the information has "exploded," the content presented to us is selected by algorithms like recommendation systems. I am concerned about this because after viewing certain topics on social media, all I see are relevant posts, making it difficult to find something new unless I actively search for it. Lastly, the author introduces plausible futures for feeds, which is quite farsighted considering we have achieved some chatbot and VR/AR technologies for displaying information that he mentioned in 2017.

                    I didn't grasp the appeal of watching Livestream; the efficiency of receiving information seems relatively low. What is the enjoyment in watching Livestream together?
                    What are some interesting possible ways future feeds could evolve?</p>

                <h2>Dot Tuer - Beyond the New Media Frame The Poet</h2>
                <p>This article explores creative approaches to transforming traditional games into digital art and a website that archives lost artworks from WWII. Through these examples, the author contemplates how past and future art interrelate, emphasizing that "the past only arrives when the future has been built to contain it". This perspective suggests that preserving and making space for lost art forms enhances future creativity, fostering reinterpretations of these gaps with new artistic meanings. This reminds me of the game Black Myth: Wukong, which brings ancient, partially destroyed Buddhist statues and architecture back to life through digital recreation. Notably, it reanimates an impaired, headless statue as a boss character, vividly reconstructing elements of lost historical and religious art. This digital approach not only archives these ancient forms but reimagines them, letting players interact with and recontextualize them in a modern narrative.

                    Does the value of archiving lost art lie solely in its recreation and potential to inspire new works?
                    What principles define an effective digital archive for lost art?</p>

                <h2>Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</h2>
                <p>The article uses comics to creatively explore the dual nature of computers and technology. On one side, they shape human behavior, reshaping our habits and how we understand the world. On the other, they drive innovation, connect people, and enable societal transformation. Gem’s journey highlights the realization that her identity and capabilities should not be defined by technology. Instead, she learns to value real-life experiences and her community, emphasizing the importance of living with uncertainty, rooting in human relationships, and fostering change.

                    How do computers change our way of thinking? For example, do we use input-output or computational methods to organize our thoughts?

                <h2>Boris Groys - Art on the Internet</h2>
                <p>This article offers a thought-provoking examination of how the Internet influences art in terms of form, meaning, creation, and its future trajectory. It highlights how the "gaze" of the Internet—a form of constant surveillance—blurs the boundary between fiction and reality, as the digital realm always points back to something tangible offline. The Internet enables vast audiences to critique art, dissolving traditional selection standards upheld by museums and theaters. It also tracks the process of artistic creation, bringing unprecedented transparency to what was once a private endeavor. The author delves into the evolving dynamics between tradition, modern, and postmodernity. In the modern context, artists sought to escape imposed identities, striving to express their "true selves" through art. However, postmodern artists began to embrace their nominal identities as ready-mades, using them in playful or subversive ways. With the Internet, this evolution continues, as artists now manifest themselves freely, unrestricted by rigid terminologies. Furthermore, the Internet as an archive transforms art into a prolonged presence, capable of influencing the future differently than politics, which shapes the world through immediate, practical actions.
                    
                    Does the statement "The Internet quantifies the global success of an author" imply that the popularity or number of views dictates an artwork’s success? What other metrics might be considered?
                    The article notes that some artists attempt to escape the "gaze" and redefine their identities through absence and creative reinvention. Why, then, do modern artists increasingly use their nominal identities as artistic tools to organize intricate games with their personas?
                    In the context of artistic creation, what constitutes a "true self"? Is it better understood as the process of creating or the final outcome of the creation?</p>
